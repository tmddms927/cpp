If you're talking about copying the contents of a istream into a string,
then one way to do it is to use an ostringstream. You can insert the
streambuf pointer from the istream into the ostringstream and then get
the string from that. For example:

#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>

int main()
{
std::ifstream in("textfile.txt");
std::ostringstream out;

out << in.rdbuf();

std::string s = out.str();

return 0;
}

Hope this helps,
